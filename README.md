## What is TEA?

`TEA` is a desktop `template engine` with `GUI`. TEA is focused on the separation of working files and files that will get to the host. In particular, TEA is great for generating `static websites`.

## Quick start

* Download the latest version of the app [here](https://github.com/DARKNEET69/TemplateEngineApp/releases/tag/0.0.1).
* Launch the app.
* Click the `Create project` button to create a project folder or the `Open project` button if this folder already exists.

  > Please note that the project must contain `projects folders`: "Templates/", "Website/", "Workspace/" and the file "TemplateSettings.json".
  > In the "Templates/" folder you should store your `templates`. Templates can contain `any html text` or an insertion block of another template.
  > In the "Workspace/" folder you should store your files using `templates`. To make the program understand that you want to use a template, use the `template insertion block` (by default `[[...]]`, where instead of "..." you need to insert a link to a template inside the project, for example "Templates/head.html") in the right place of your text.
  
* If you have changed the settings in the application and want to save them, click the `Save settings` button. All personal settings of the application will be saved in `Template Settings.json`.
* Click the `Generate` button to generate the website files in the "Website/" folder.
